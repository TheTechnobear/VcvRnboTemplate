need to add to documenation details about 
- copy vcvmodules svg
- generate assets for mm 

and/or change create module to use generic blank assets, 
if so, create assets for differnt sizes. 5u, 10u 20u?


add disclaimer ?
as you need to pay for max and rnbo, Id suggest users first setup this environment and test with the 'demo'
so they know it will work on thier computer , and they are 'happy' with it


additional notes
whilst 'developer' needs max/rnbo users of created plugins do not.
